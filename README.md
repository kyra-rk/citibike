# citibike

Kyra Ramesh Krishna

Started this project in December 2023 to explore python and pandas a little more. I have a Citi Bike annual membership, so there's a little bit of a personal incentive to explore their public trip dataset. I'm curious to see how other NYC residents/visitors are using Citi Bikes and if there's any fun statistics I can glean from the data online. 

This is also an opportunity for me to get more comfortable working with python and pandas in a data science context. Maybe if all goes well I'll even one day try to do a project on this/or on something similar for NYC Data Week :) 

I'll come back to this readme later and dress it up a little to explain my project and process. This is to hold myself accountable in the meantime.
